    Mike wanted to install cockroachDB on his linux server

    but upon completion he couldn't get v1.0.2 downloaded so he ended up with v1.1.4

    learning_cockroachDB

    he forgot that v1.0.2 was sitting in cockroach and should have taken it out, so he left it
    he found out that he did not have node installed so he stopped everything he was doing
    to stop cockroach he killed process

        autospa+  5437  2.6  1.8 335092 148824 pts/4   Sl   21:56   0:20 cockroach start --insecure --host=localhost

    it said it was good
    he is going to kill the second on but the pid changed from 5737 to 5755
    it keeps changing its pid
    he tried to kill it but he cldnt, now he has
    REMOVE ZOMBIE COCKROACH PROCESS,
    PROPERLY CLEAN SYSTEM OF COCKROACH STARTING WITH V1.1.4 in that computer folder

----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    he started by learning node he might need to download it first
    
        he downloaded curl first using
    
            sudo apt install curl

        https://askubuntu.com/questions/307/how-can-ppas-be-removed
        then added ppa-purge

        sudo apt-get install ppa-purge

        then
            
            sudo ppa-purge ppa:chris-lea/node.js
            
        cldnt do it , bash said apt-get update failed for some reason and when going to /etc/apt/sources.list.d the files related to chris-lea ppa were still there, so we need to update the update


        further steps

            sudo apt-get upgrade
            sudo ppa-purge ppa:chris-lea/node.js  ---------
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo ppa-purge ppa:chris-lea/node.js  ---------
            cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
            rm chris-lea-ubuntu-node_js-xenial.list chris-lea-ubuntu-node_js-xenial.list.save
            sudo rm chris-lea-ubuntu-node_js-xenial.list chris-lea-ubuntu-node_js-xenial.list.save
            cd /home/autospark/My_Computer/Summer_2017/Node_folder
            curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash
                ** it told me run it as root but I used sudo instead its the same right??**
            sudo apt-get install nodejs

            Sucess

        on executing sudo npm cache clean -f
        it told me it hopes I know what i am doing
            
        I continued upon finishing updating and trying out the test, everything went good so I guess we are alright

    Mike decided to run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
    on the site he referred to it seems to be that he was supposed to run

    	
     upgrade or dist-upgrade, not both, and update always comes first. â€“ Reinier Post Oct 12 '16 at 14:04

    so while writing to stringdeecoder_example1.js in /home/autospark/My_Computer/Summer_2017/Node_folder from
    192.168.1.4, confusion occured, the  terminal could not really remove the file and had to use remote default file manager to remove it properly

    /home/autospark/My_Computer/Summer_2017/Node_folder/Express_folder/learning_express.txt

    Michael decided to install express here are the steps he executed

        npm install -g express
        sudo npm install -g express
        npm install body-parser --save
            forgot npm init so it made a package-lock.json
        npm install cookie-parser --save
            npm is really looking for the package.json file so he finally init it
        npm init
            it made the entry point basic_express.js
        npm install multer --save
            put every local npm package into the json, package-lock.json seems to hold everything needed to npm to run
        he tried to run an express app and looks like you need express locally -----
        sudo npm install express --save

        SUCCESS
