    Mike wanted to install cockroachDB on his linux server

    but upon completion he couldn't get v1.0.2 downloaded so he ended up with v1.1.4

    learning_cockroachDB

    he forgot that v1.0.2 was sitting in cockroach and should have taken it out, so he left it
    he found out that he did not have node installed so he stopped everything he was doing
    to stop cockroach he killed process

        autospa+  5437  2.6  1.8 335092 148824 pts/4   Sl   21:56   0:20 cockroach start --insecure --host=localhost

    it said it was good
    he is going to kill the second on but the pid changed from 5737 to 5755
    it keeps changing its pid
    he tried to kill it but he cldnt, now he has
    REMOVE ZOMBIE COCKROACH PROCESS,
    PROPERLY CLEAN SYSTEM OF COCKROACH STARTING WITH V1.1.4 in that computer folder

----------------------------------------------------------------

    he started by learning node he might need to download it first

        he downloaded curl first using

            sudo apt install curl

        https://askubuntu.com/questions/307/how-can-ppas-be-removed
        then added ppa-purge

        sudo apt-get install ppa-purge

        then

            sudo ppa-purge ppa:chris-lea/node.js

        cldnt do it , bash said apt-get update failed for some reason and when going to /etc/apt/sources.list.d the files related to chris-lea ppa were still there, so we need to update the update


        further steps

            sudo apt-get upgrade
            sudo ppa-purge ppa:chris-lea/node.js  ---------
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo ppa-purge ppa:chris-lea/node.js  ---------
            cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
            rm chris-lea-ubuntu-node_js-xenial.list chris-lea-ubuntu-node_js-xenial.list.save
            sudo rm chris-lea-ubuntu-node_js-xenial.list chris-lea-ubuntu-node_js-xenial.list.save
            cd /home/autospark/My_Computer/Summer_2017/Node_folder
            curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash
                ** it told me run it as root but I used sudo instead its the same right??**
            sudo apt-get install nodejs

            Sucess

        on executing sudo npm cache clean -f
        it told me it hopes I know what i am doing

        I continued upon finishing updating and trying out the test, everything went good so I guess we are alright

        npm install -g express

            forgot npm init so it made a package-lock.json
        npm install cookie-parser --save
            npm is really looking for the package.json file so he finally init it
        npm init
            it made the entry point basic_express.js
        npm install multer --save
            put every local npm package into the json, package-lock.json seems to hold everything needed to npm to run
        he tried to run an express app and looks like you need express locally -----

      steps
        open SYSTEM settings
        open backups
        choose the second button to install the necessary software
        before backuing up michael wanted some folders to be ignored
        so I choose ones that had .git extensions or node modules because they are really big and useless
        its asking me for a password,I will put the same one to login to my desktop because it is long and hard

        Mike wants to setup an NGINX server on his linux laptop

        version
        chmod -  /var/www -755

        says that
        guide assumes that youâ€™re working with a version of Nginx installed from the default repositories of a Debian-based distribution

        steps
1
        ln -s /bin/git_superbranch_backup_control.bat ~/Script_helpers/
        ln -s /bin/website_git.bat ~/Script_helpers/
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install nginx
1A
        sudo ufw app list
            Nginx Full: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)
            Nginx HTTP: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic)
            Nginx HTTPS: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic
Since we haven't configured SSL for our server yet, in this guide, we will only need to allow traffic on port 80.
        sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
        sudo ufw status
        found -- returns inactive
            result starting ufw with step 2
2
            cd /etc/default/
            sudo vim ufw
                added -- IPV6=yes
Let's set your UFW rules back to the defaults
            sudo ufw default deny incoming
            sudo ufw default allow outgoing
this might not allow me to do things remotely, switching to local server then
Now allow incoming ssh
            sudo ufw allow ssh
same as
            sudo ufw allow 22
if you changed it you must type in the port number
to enable UFW
            sudo ufw enable
            sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.7
1A
        systemctl status nginx
As you can see above, the service appears to have started successfully. However, the best way to test this is to actually request a page from Nginx.
You can access the default Nginx landing page to confirm that the software is running properly. You can access this through your server's domain name or IP address.
to setup up a domain name

        make a digitalocean dns account
        not a good idea, impossible to contact customer service, do not know what is free or not
1A
        ip addr show eth0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'
        try the results in the web browser see if they work
        [my step]
        ip addr
        ip addr show [number_key] | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'
        try the results in the web browser see if they work
so it might be using localhost 127.0.0.1
ip addr show lo | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'
so it might be using its indiviual ip 192.168.1.4
ip addr show wlo1 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'

we'll try to work with that individual ip

        the nginx server is running properly

I dont think I can use the url example.com and test.com. I see example.com was made for it while someone must be using test.com so I only used test.com
        sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
        sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/html
        
        mkdir ok
        sudo chmod -R 755 .ok
        sudo rm -rf ok
Do not need to change /var/www
        vim /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
        added- some content
        sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
        sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
        added -- some edting
        grep -R default_server /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
        sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        added -uncommented a line
        sudo nginx -t
        sudo systemctl restart nginx
        local $ sudo nano /etc/hosts
        found --error local can only be used in a function
        sudo vim /etc/hosts
            added -- host name and example site I wanted to work with
            useless but helps for a bit

        SUCCESS
        now you need a domain name
        and figure out how to host any of your index pages on /var/www/html
