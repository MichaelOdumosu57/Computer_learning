learning about how a computer works


    Computer Types
    
        Analogue computers- render output about changing physical values
        Digital computers- use binary or number input and use programs to learn about them
        Hybrid Computer- is the best of both worlds
        
        Supercomputer- process trillions of instructions thousands of interconnected processors
        Mainframe computer - for the use of 100's of user, for banking and commercial use
        Miniframe computer - used for employess to keep track of goods
        Workstation - a computer specialized for producing products
        Microcomputer- your everyday computer
        
    Computer Components
    
        input - use of input devices to enter raw info to the computer
        store - primary and secondary storage that holds data and instruction before send to the Central Processing Unit and before displaying it as output
        process - turning into useful info, Computer process displays and sends its back to storage as useful information
        output - presenting data through output devices
        controll- makes sure everything is done correctly
        
        input devices-
        
            keyboard- uses keys, common QWERTY is the common one
            mouse- controls movement of cursor and screen posiition
            scanners - uses pictures or text as input, and turns digital, flatbed scanners are input
            joystick - it is for more game like use and it controls the cursor
            lightpen - for signinig things. Reacts by hitting the screen, good for drawing
            trackball -used when do not have enough room for mouse, senses movement of ball
            digitizer - screen that comes with stylus, allows user to draw detailed images
            microphone- turns sound into digitial data stored in the
            Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR)- process the ink found on checks
            Optical Character Reader (OCR) - a mini scaners takes, the objects or texts it sees and records it
            
        output devices-
        
            monitors
            
                CRT monitor - CRT monitors are based on the cathode ray tubes. Cathode rays tube produces beam of electrons that strikes on the inner phosphorescent surface of screen to produce images on the screen.
                
                LCD monitor - has two screens with liquid crystal between them, when light passes, the crystal alters it for the final color output using cold cathode flourescent
                
                LED monitor - does same thing as LCD but uses light emitting diodes
                
                PLASMA sCREEN- uses plasma gas and by applying energy, the plasma changes color
                
            printers-
            
                Impact printers- uses a hammer to strike an ink ribbon to print paper
                
                    Character printers - does this one character at a time
                    
                    Dot matrix printers - done with a matrix of dots
                    
                    daisy wheel printer - looks for characters on wheel, then takes the paper offset to that character and the character is printer
                    
                    
        
        Central Processing Unit
        
            process for everything in the computer
            stores important OS programs
            help input and output devices to communicate with each other
                    
                    
            has 3 parts
            
                Memory: It is called Random access memory (RAM). It temporarily stores data, programs and intermediate and final results of processing.
                
                Control Unit: It controls and coordinates the functioning of all parts of computer. It does not involve in processing and storing data.
                
                ALU: It performs arithmetic and logical functions. Arithmetic functions include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Logical functions mainly include selecting, comparing and merging the data.
                
                
        Hardware
                
        parts of a computer that you touch
        
            Motherboard - thin piece of equipment that holds the computer together
                          allocates power to all pieces
                          allows the pieces to communciate with each other
                          
            
        Software
        
            a collection of data and instructions that the computer follows to do its tasks
            
            programming language - a way for users to understand and control what the hardware of a machine does
            
            data- a collection of energy patterns that represent objects that the machine can use in order to do its tasks
            
            program - another collection of energy patters that the machine takes as instruction to transport or change whatever data it is already working with, or make alterations to itself with the same or different energy
            
            
    Computer Memory
    
         The computer memory is divided into large number of small parts known as cells. Each cell has a unique address which varies from 0 to memory size minus one.
         
         Computer memory is of two types: Volatile (RAM) and Non-volatile (ROM). The secondary memory (hard disk) is referred as storage not memory.
         
         
         however based on spatial reference we have four types
         
             Register memory - hold in register found in CPU, holds data, instructions and memory addreses, that the CPU needs and users work with it using Aseembly Languages such as MIPS
             
             Cache memory - faster than main memory, if CPU finds what it needs there it uses it and makes system performance faster
         
         
            Primary Memory -
         
                RAM -means it loses its data, when you turn on your computer, hard disk sends data to the RAM, upon turning it of RAM loses it
                
                ROM - means it keeps it data, important for booting processes
                
            Secondary Memory -
            
                a ROM memory that the CPU has to use the primary memory in order to get it
                
                    Hard disk - It is a rigid magnetic disc that is used to store data. It permanently stores data and is located within a drive unit.
                    
                    Optical disk- It has a plastic coating. The data in optical disc is recorded digitally and the recorded data is read with laser that scans its surface.
                    
                    Pen drive - It is a compact secondary storage device. It is connected to a computer through a USB port to store or retrieve data.
                    
                    
                    
            Memory Units
            
                Memory units are used to measure and represent data. Some of the commonly used memory units are:
                
                    1) Bit: The computer memory units start from bit. A bit is the smallest memory unit to measure data stored in main memory and storage devices. A bit can have only one binary value out of 0 and 1.
                    
                    2) Byte: It is the fundamental unit to measure data. It contains 8 bits or is equal to 8 bits. Thus a byte can represent 2*8 or 256 values.
                    
                    3) Kilobyte: A kilobyte contains 1024 bytes.
                    
                    4) Megabyte: A megabyte contains 1024 kilobytes.
                    
                    5) Gigabyte: A gigabyte contains 1024 megabyte.
                    
                    6) Terabyte: A terabyte contains 1024 gigabytes.
                    
                    
                    
    Computer Network
        
        anytime computers are made to share some sort of connection and are aware of each other, this is a network, when all are not aware, this is hacking, and when data is transported this is an active network
        
        As the name suggests, the local area network is confined to small geographical area like within an office, company, school or any other organization. Ethernet cables are used to set up LAN.
        
        Metropolitan area network extends over a metropolitan area like a city or town. It is set up by connecting the local area networks of the city or town. It is ideal for the people of a particular region to share data or information
        
        Wide area network covers large geographical area. It is not confined within office, school or a town. It is mainly set up by telecommunication lines. Big organizations like banks and multinational companies communicate with their branches and customers through WAN. Internet that we use is also a WAN.
    
    
    Computer Virus
    
        the computer form of sickness, unwanted software that causes significant detrimental interefence in the functioning of the computer. Any malicious software activity to a computer that leads to the harming of the computer or the inablity of the user of the use it efficiently is known as a virus. Any hardware activity is known as breaking the computer
        
        
        
            Overwrite Virus - Overwrite virus is the simplest computer virus. It overwrites the code of infected file with its own malicious code. The content of infected file is replaced partially or completely but the size of file does not change.
                
            Macro virus- a macro is a single insturction by a programming language which intrprets as multiple tasks for the CPU. A macro virus gets to a file and corrputs its macros, it is deadly, because when a program opens the corrputed file the macros sends corruptive instruction to the CPU
            
            Boot virus - changes how your computer boots up enters though corrupt media files, infected storage devices and insecure computer networks.
            
            Resident Virus - stays in the RAM and corrupts the computer once RAM
            
            Multipartite Virus - spreads and infects everything its capable of
            
            File Infector Virus - most common, found in execuatables. Upon execution it rewrites the files destroying them
            
        Computer Worm - its not like a virus because it does not need a host program to cause problems. Comes mostly in e-mails
            
        Trojan Horse - hides in a program ,upon installation it can
                        provide unauthorized access
                        sends files places
                        make computer do unwanted things


    Number Systems
    
        those binary, octal, hex, and decimal number system that computers turn inital data too as an understanding point
        
        
    Internet
